## Automatic Retries on Error

JOSDK will schedule an automatic retry of the reconciliation whenever an exception is thrown by
your `Reconciler`. The retry behavior is configurable, but a default implementation is provided
covering most of the typical use-cases, see
[GenericRetry](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/java-operator-sdk/blob/master/operator-framework-core/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/operator/processing/retry/GenericRetry.java)
.

```java
    GenericRetry.defaultLimitedExponentialRetry()
        .setInitialInterval(5000)
        .setIntervalMultiplier(1.5D)
        .setMaxAttempts(5);
```

You can also configure the default retry behavior using the `@GradualRetry` annotation.

It is possible to provide a custom implementation using the `retry` field of the
`@ControllerConfiguration` annotation and specifying the class of your custom implementation.
Note that this class must provide an accessible no-arg constructor for automated
instantiation. Additionally, your implementation can be automatically configured from an
annotation that you can provide by having your `Retry` implementation implement the
`AnnotationConfigurable` interface, parameterized with your annotation type. See the
`GenericRetry` implementation for more details.

Information about the current retry state is accessible from
the [Context](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/java-operator-sdk/blob/master/operator-framework-core/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/operator/api/Context.java)
object. Of note, particularly interesting is the `isLastAttempt` method, which could allow your
`Reconciler` to implement a different behavior based on this status, by setting an error message
in your resource status, for example, when attempting a last retry.

Note, though, that reaching the retry limit won't prevent new events to be processed. New
reconciliations will happen for new events as usual. However, if an error also occurs that
would trigger a retry, the SDK won't schedule one at this point since the retry limit
has already been reached.

A successful execution resets the retry state.

### Reconciler Error Handler

In order to facilitate error reporting you can override [`updateErrorStatus`](https://github.com/operator-framework/java-operator-sdk/blob/main/operator-framework-core/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/operator/api/reconciler/Reconciler.java#L52)
method in `Reconciler`:

```java
public class MyReconciler implements Reconciler<WebPage> {

   @Override
   public ErrorStatusUpdateControl<WebPage> updateErrorStatus(
           WebPage resource, Context<WebPage> context, Exception e) {
      return handleError(resource, e);
   }

}
```

The `updateErrorStatus` method is called in case an exception is thrown from the `Reconciler`. It is
also called even if no retry policy is configured, just after the reconciler execution.
`RetryInfo.getAttemptCount()` is zero after the first reconciliation attempt, since it is not a
result of a retry (regardless of whether a retry policy is configured).

`ErrorStatusUpdateControl` tells the SDK what to do and how to perform the status
update on the primary resource, which is always performed as a status sub-resource request. Note that
this update request will also produce an event and result in a reconciliation if the
controller is not generation-aware.

This feature is only available for the `reconcile` method of the `Reconciler` interface, since
There should not be updates to resources that have been marked for deletion.

Retry can be skipped in cases of unrecoverable errors:

```java
 ErrorStatusUpdateControl.patchStatus(customResource).withNoRetry();
```

### Correctness and Automatic Retries

While it is possible to deactivate automatic retries, this is not desirable unless there is a particular reason.
Errors naturally occur, whether it be transient network errors or conflicts
when a given resource is handled by a `Reconciler` but modified simultaneously by a user in
a different process. Automatic retries handle these cases nicely and will eventually result in a
successful reconciliation.

## Retry, Rescheduling and Event Handling Common Behavior

Retry, reschedule, and standard event processing form a relatively complex system, each of these
functionalities interacting with the others. In the following, we describe the interplay of
these features:

1. A successful execution resets a retry and the rescheduled executions that were present before
   the reconciliation. However, the reconciliation outcome can instruct a new rescheduling (`UpdateControl` or `DeleteControl`).

   For example, if a reconciliation had previously been rescheduled for after some amount of time, but an event triggered
   the reconciliation (or cleanup) in the meantime, the scheduled execution would be automatically cancelled, i.e.
   rescheduling a reconciliation does not guarantee that one will occur precisely at that time; it simply guarantees that a reconciliation will occur at the latest.
   Of course, it's always possible to reschedule a new reconciliation at the end of that "automatic" reconciliation.

   Similarly, if a retry was scheduled, any event from the cluster triggering a successful execution in the meantime
   would cancel the scheduled retry (because there's now no point in retrying something that already succeeded)

3. In case an exception is thrown, a retry is initiated. However, if an event is received
   meanwhile, it will be reconciled instantly, and this execution won't count as a retry attempt.
4. If the retry limit is reached (so no more automatic retry would happen), but a new event
   received, the reconciliation will still happen, but won't reset the retry, and will still be
   marked as the last attempt in the retry info. The point (1) still holds - thus successful reconciliation will reset the retry - but no retry will happen in case of an error.
   
The thing to remember when it comes to retrying or rescheduling is that JOSDK tries to avoid unnecessary work. When
you reschedule an operation, you instruct JOSDK to perform that operation by the end of the rescheduling
delay at the latest. If something occurred on the cluster that triggers that particular operation (reconciliation or cleanup), then
JOSDK considers that there's no point in attempting that operation again at the end of the specified delay since there
is no point in doing so anymore. The same idea also applies to retries.
