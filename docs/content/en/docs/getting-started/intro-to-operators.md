## Introduction & Resources 

Operators manage both cluster and non-cluster resources on behalf of Kubernetes. Java
Operator SDK (JOSDK) aims to make it as easy as possible to implement a Kubernetes operators in Java.
The APIs are designed to feel natural to Java developers. In addition the framework tries to 
handle common problem out of the box, so you don't have to worry about generic sub-problems.

For an introduction on operators, please see this
[blog post](https://blog.container-solutions.com/kubernetes-operators-explained).

For introductions to JOSDK see [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvftaV-xrB4).

You can read about the common problems JOSDK is solving for you
[here](https://blog.container-solutions.com/a-deep-dive-into-the-java-operator-sdk).
