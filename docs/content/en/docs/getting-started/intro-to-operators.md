## Introduction & Resources 

Operators manage both cluster and non-cluster resources on behalf of Kubernetes. The Java Operator SDK (JOSDK) makes it easy to implement Kubernetes operators in Java. Our APIs are designed to feel natural to Java developers, and the framework handles common problems out of the box so you can focus on your business logic.

For an introduction to operators, see this [blog post](https://blog.container-solutions.com/kubernetes-operators-explained).

For introductions to JOSDK, watch [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvftaV-xrB4).

Learn about the common problems JOSDK solves [here](https://blog.container-solutions.com/a-deep-dive-into-the-java-operator-sdk).
