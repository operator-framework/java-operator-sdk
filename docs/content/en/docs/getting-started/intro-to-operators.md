## What are Kubernetes Operators?

Kubernetes operators are software extensions that manage both cluster and non-cluster resources on behalf of Kubernetes. The Java Operator SDK (JOSDK) makes it easy to implement Kubernetes operators in Java, with APIs designed to feel natural to Java developers and framework handling of common problems so you can focus on your business logic.

## Why Use Java Operator SDK?

JOSDK provides several key advantages:

- **Java-native APIs** that feel familiar to Java developers
- **Automatic handling** of common operator challenges (caching, event handling, retries)
- **Production-ready features** like observability, metrics, and error handling
- **Simplified development** so you can focus on business logic instead of Kubernetes complexities
