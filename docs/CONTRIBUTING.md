### Contributor License Agreement

All contributions must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; the CLA simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project. 

Visit <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one (even for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again.
