# Migrating from v4.7 to v5.0

## API Tweaks

1. [Result of managed dependent resources](https://github.com/operator-framework/java-operator-sdk/blob/main/operator-framework-core/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/operator/api/reconciler/dependent/managed/ManagedDependentResourceContext.java#L55-L57)
   is not `Optional` anymore. In case you use this result, simply use the result
   objects directly.
2. `EventSourceInitializer` is not a separate interface anymore. It is part of the `Reconciler` interface with a
   default implementation. You can simply remove this interface from your reconciler. The
   [`EventSourceUtils`](https://github.com/operator-framework/java-operator-sdk/blob/main/operator-framework-core/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/operator/api/reconciler/EventSourceUtils.java#L11-L11)
   now contains all the utility methods used for event sources naming that were previously defined in
   the `EventSourceInitializer` interface.
