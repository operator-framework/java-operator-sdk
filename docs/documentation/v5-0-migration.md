# Migrating from v4.7 to v5.0

## API Tweaks

1. [Result of managed dependent resources](https://github.com/operator-framework/java-operator-sdk/blob/main/operator-framework-core/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/operator/api/reconciler/dependent/managed/ManagedDependentResourceContext.java#L55-L57)
   is not `Optional` anymore. In case you use this result, simply use the result
   objects directly.
2. `EventSourceInitializer` is not a separate interface anymore. It is part of the `Reconciler` interface with a
   default implementation. You can simply remove this interface from your reconciler. The
   [`EventSourceUtils`](https://github.com/operator-framework/java-operator-sdk/blob/main/operator-framework-core/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/operator/api/reconciler/EventSourceUtils.java#L11-L11)
   now contains all the utility methods used for event sources naming that were previously defined in
   the `EventSourceInitializer` interface.
3. Patching status through `UpdateControl` like the `patchStatus` method now by default
   uses Server Side Apply instead of simple patch. To use the former approach, use the feature flag 
   in [`ConfigurationService`](https://github.com/operator-framework/java-operator-sdk/blob/main/operator-framework-core/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/operator/api/config/ConfigurationService.java#L400-L400)
   !!! IMPORTANT !!!
   Migration from a non-SSA based controller to SSA based controller can cause problems, due to known issues. 
   See the following [integration test](https://github.com/operator-framework/java-operator-sdk/blob/main/operator-framework/src/test/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/operator/StatusPatchSSAMigrationIT.java#L71-L82) where it is demonstrated.
   Also, the related part of a [workaround](https://github.com/operator-framework/java-operator-sdk/blob/main/operator-framework/src/test/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/operator/StatusPatchSSAMigrationIT.java#L110-L116).
4. `ManagedDependentResourceContext` has been renamed to `ManagedWorkflowAndDependentResourceContext` and is accessed
   via the accordingly renamed `managedWorkflowAndDependentResourceContext` method.
5. `ResourceDiscriminator` was removed. In most of the cases you can just delete the discriminator, everything should
    work without it by default. To optimize and handle special cases see the relevant section in [Dependent Resource documentation](/docs/dependent-resources#multiple-dependent-resources-of-same-type).
