## Contextual Info for Logging with MDC

Logging is enhanced with additional contextual information using [MDC](http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html#mdc). 
This following attributes are available in most parts of reconciliation logic and during the execution of the controller:

| MDC Key      | Value added from Custom Resource |
| :---        |    :---   | 
| `resource.apiVersion`   | `.apiVersion` |
| `resource.kind`   | `.kind` |
| `resource.name`      | `.metadata.name` | 
| `resource.namespace`   | `.metadata.namespace` |
| `resource.resourceVersion`   | `.metadata.resourceVersion` |
| `resource.generation`   | `.metadata.generation` |
| `resource.uid`   | `.metadata.uid` |
