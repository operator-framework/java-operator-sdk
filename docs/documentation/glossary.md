# Glossary

- **Primary Resource** - the resource that represents the desired state that the controller is
  working to achieve. While this is often a Custom Resource, it can be also be a Kubernetes native
  resource (Deployment, ConfigMap,...).
- **Secondary Resource** - any resource that the controller needs to manage the reach the desired
  state represented by the primary resource. These resources can be created, updated, deleted or 
  simply read depending on the use case. For example, the `Deployment` controller manages 
  `ReplicatSet` instances when trying to realize the state represented by the `Deployment`. In 
  this scenario, the `Deployment` is the primary resource while `ReplicaSet` is one of the 
  secondary resources managed by the `Deployment` controller.
- **Dependent Resource** - a feature of JOSDK, to make it easier to manage secondary resources. A
  dependent resource represents a secondary resource with related reconciliation logic.
- **Low-level API** - refers to the SDK APIs that don't use any of features (such as Dependent
  Resources or Workflows) outside of the core
- [`Reconciler`](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/java-operator-sdk/blob/main/operator-framework-core/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/operator/api/reconciler/Reconciler.java)
  interface. See
  the [WebPage sample](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/java-operator-sdk/blob/main/sample-operators/webpage/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/operator/sample/WebPageReconciler.java)
  . The same logic
  is also implemented using
  [Dependent Resource and Workflows](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/java-operator-sdk/blob/main/sample-operators/webpage/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/operator/sample/WebPageManagedDependentsReconciler.java)
