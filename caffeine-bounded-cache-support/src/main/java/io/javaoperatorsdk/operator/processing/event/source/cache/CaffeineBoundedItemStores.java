/**
 * The idea about CaffeinBoundedItemStore-s is that, caffeine will cache the resources which were
 * recently used, and will evict resource, which are not used for a while. This is ideal from the
 * perspective that on startup controllers reconcile all resources (this is why a maxSize not ideal)
 * but after a while it can happen (well depending on the controller and domain) that only some
 * resources are actually active, thus related events happen. So in case large amount of custom
 * resources only the active once will remain in the cache. Note that if a resource is reconciled
 * all the secondary resources are usually reconciled too, in that case all those resources are
 * fetched and populated to the cache, and will remain there for some time, for a subsequent
 * reconciliations.
