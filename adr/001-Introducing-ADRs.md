# Using Architectural Decision Records

In order to into to document and facilitate discussion over architecture and other design question of the project
we introduce usage of [ADR](https://adr.github.io/).

In each ADR file, write these sections:

# Title

## Status

What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.?

## Context

What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

## Notes

Other notes optionally added to the ADR.
Soo other good materials for the ADRs:
