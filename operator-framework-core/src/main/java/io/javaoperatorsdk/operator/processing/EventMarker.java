 * processing at the moment. The third case is if a DELETE event is received, this is a special case
 * meaning that the custom resource is deleted. We don't want to do any processing anymore so other
 * events are irrelevant for us from this point. Note that the dependant resources are either
 * cleaned up by K8S garbage collection or by the controller implementation for cleanup.
