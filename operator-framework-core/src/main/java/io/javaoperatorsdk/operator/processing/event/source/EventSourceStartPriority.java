   * resources which state is being tracked since that state information might be required to
   * properly retrieve the other resources.
   * 
   * <p>
   * For example a {@code ConfigMap} could store the identifier of a fictional external resource
   * {@code A}. In this case, the event source tracking {@code A} resources might need the
   * identifier from the {@code ConfigMap} to identify and check the state of {@code A} resources.
   * This is usually needed before any reconciliation occurs and the only way to ensure the proper
   * behavior in this case is to make sure that the event source tracking the {@code ConfigMaps} (in
   * this example) is started/cache-synced before the event source for {@code A} resources gets
   * started.
