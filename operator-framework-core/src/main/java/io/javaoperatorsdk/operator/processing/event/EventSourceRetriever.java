   * Registers (and starts) the specified {@link EventSource} dynamically during the reconciliation.
   * If an EventSource is already registered with the specified name, the registration will be
   * ignored. It is the user's responsibility to handle the naming correctly.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * This is only needed when your operator needs to adapt dynamically based on optional resources
   * that may or may not be present on the target cluster. Even in this situation, it should be
   * possible to make these decisions at when the "regular" EventSources are registered so this
   * method should not typically be called directly but rather by the framework to support
   * activation conditions of dependents, for example.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * This method will block until the event source is synced (if needed, as it is the case for
   * {@link io.javaoperatorsdk.operator.processing.event.source.informer.InformerEventSource}).
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Should multiple reconciliations happen concurrently, only one
   * EventSource with the specified name will ever be registered. It is therefore important to
   * explicitly name the event sources that you want to reuse because the name will be used to
   * identify which event sources need to be created or not. If you let JOSDK implicitly name event
   * sources, then you might end up with duplicated event sources because concurrent registration of
   * event sources will lead to 2 (or more) event sources for the same resource type to be attempted
   * to be registered under different, automatically generated names. If you clearly identify your
   * event sources with names, then, if the concurrent process determines that an event source with
   * the specified name, it won't register it again.
   * </p>
   *
   * @param eventSource to register
   * @return the actual event source registered. Might not be the same as the parameter.
