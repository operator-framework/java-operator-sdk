/**
 * Identifies the set of secondary resources associated with a given primary resource. This is
 * typically needed when multiple secondary resources can be associated with one or several multiple
 * primary resources *without* a standard way (e.g. owner reference or annotations) to materialize
 * that relations. When owner references are present, a {@code PrimaryToSecondaryMapper} instance
 * should not be needed. In other words, associating such a mapper with your
 * {@link io.javaoperatorsdk.operator.api.config.informer.InformerConfiguration} is usually needed
 * when your secondary resources are referenced in some way by your primary resource but that this
 * link does not exist in the secondary resource information. The mapper implementation instructs
 * the SDK on how to find all the secondary resources associated with a given primary resource so
 * that this primary resource can properly be reconciled when changes impact the associated
 * secondary resources, even though these don't contain any information allowing to make such an
 * inference.
 * <p/>
 * This helps particularly in cases where several secondary resources, listed in some way in the
 * primary resource, need to or can be created before the primary resource exists. In that
 * situation, attempting to retrieve the associated secondary resources by calling
 * {@link io.javaoperatorsdk.operator.api.reconciler.Context#getSecondaryResource(Class)} would fail
 * without providing a mapper to tell JOSDK how to retrieve the secondary resources.
 * <p/>
 * You can see an example of this in action in the <a href=
 * "https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/java-operator-sdk/blob/main/operator-framework/src/test/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/operator/sample/primarytosecondary/JobReconciler.java">Reconciler
 * for the PrimaryToSecondaryIT</a> integration tests that handles many-to-many relationship.
