/**
 * <p>
 * Wraps informer(s) so it is connected to the eventing system of the framework. Note that since
 * it's it is built on top of Informers, it also support caching resources using caching from
 * fabric8 client Informer caches and additional caches described below.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * InformerEventSource also supports two features to better handle events and caching of resources
 * on top of Informers from fabric8 Kubernetes client. These two features implementation wise are
 * related to each other:
 * </p>
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * 1. API that allows to make sure the cache contains the fresh resource after an update. This is
 * important for {@link io.javaoperatorsdk.operator.api.reconciler.dependent.DependentResource} and
 * mainly for
 * {@link io.javaoperatorsdk.operator.processing.dependent.kubernetes.KubernetesDependentResource}
 * so after reconcile if getResource() called always return the fresh resource. To achieve this
 * handleRecentResourceUpdate() and handleRecentResourceCreate() needs to be called explicitly after
 * resource created/updated using the kubernetes client. (These calls are done automatically by
 * KubernetesDependentResource implementation.). In the background this will store the new resource
 * in a temporary cache {@link TemporaryResourceCache} which do additional checks. After a new event
 * is received the cachec object is removed from this cache, since in general then it is already in
 * the cache of informer.
 * </p>
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * 2. Additional API is provided that is ment to be used with the combination of the previous one,
 * and the goal is to filter out events that are the results of updates and creates made by the
 * controller itself. For example if in reconciler a ConfigMaps is created, there should be an
 * Informer in place to handle change events of that ConfigMap, but since it has bean created (or
 * updated) by the reconciler this should not trigger an additional reconciliation by default. In
 * order to achieve this prepareForCreateOrUpdateEventFiltering(..) method needs to be called before
 * the operation of the k8s client. And the operation from point 1. after the k8s client call. See
 * it's usage in CreateUpdateEventFilterTestReconciler integration test for the usage. (Again this
 * is managed for the developer if using dependent resources.) <br>
 * Roughly it works in a way that before the K8S API call is made, we set mark the resource ID, and
 * from that point informer won't propagate events further just will start record them. After the
 * client operation is done, it's checked and analysed what events were received and based on that
 * it will propagate event or not and/or put the new resource into the temporal cache - so if the
 * event not arrived yet about the update will be able to filter it in the future.
 * </p>
