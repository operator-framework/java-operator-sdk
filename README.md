## What is Java Operator SDK

Java Operator SDK is a higher level framework and related tooling to support writing Kubernetes Operators in Java.
It makes it easy to implement best practices and patters for an Operator. Features include: 

* Optimal handling Kubernetes API events
* Handling dependent resources, related events, caching.
* Automatic Retries
* Smart event scheduling
* Handling Observed Generations automatically
* Easy to use Error Handling
* ... and everything that a batteries included framework needs 

For all features and their usage see the [related section on the website](https://javaoperatorsdk.io/docs/features).
