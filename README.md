## What is Java Operator SDK

Java Operator SDK is a higher level framework and related tooling to support writing Kubernetes Operators in Java.
It makes it easy to implement best practices and patters for an Operator. Features include: 

* Optimal handling Kubernetes API events
* Handling dependent resources, related events, caching.
* Automatic Retries
* Smart event scheduling
* Handling Observed Generations automatically
* Easy to use Error Handling
* ... and everything that a batteries included framework needs 

For all features and their usage see the [related section on the website](https://javaoperatorsdk.io/docs/features).

## Projects using JOSDK

While we know of multiple projects using JOSDK in production, we don't want to presume these 
projects want to advertise that fact here. For this reason, we ask that if you'd like your project 
to be featured in this section, please open a PR, adding a link to and short description of your 
project, as shown below:

- [ExposedApp operator](https://github.com/halkyonio/exposedapp-rhdblog): a sample operator 
  written to illustrate JOSDK concepts and its Quarkus extension in the ["Write Kubernetes 
  Operators in Java with the Java Operator SDK" blog series](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/02/15/write-kubernetes-java-java-operator-sdk#).
- [Keycloak operator](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/tree/main/operator): the official
  Keycloak operator, built with Quarkus and JOSDK.
- [Apache Flink Kubernetes operator](https://github.com/apache/flink-kubernetes-operator) is the market lead among Flink operators.
- [Strimzi Access operator](https://github.com/strimzi/kafka-access-operator). While the core Strimzi operator development predates  
  JOSDK, but new components like the Access operator is using the framework.
